# Twilight

Private [Discord](https://discord.com) bot handling schedules for [Power Nappers](https://powernappers.com) teams.
Currently just handles Power Dragons schedules but will add support for other teams later.

# Why?

Bored and need something to motivate me to keep writing code.
Also gives me an excuse to learn Discord message components.

# How to run?
In both commands, the bot's token needs to be passed as an environment variable called `TWILIGHT_TOKEN`.
Either `gradlew run` or build a shaded jar with `gradlew shadowJar`. Do note that this bot has hardcoded IDs
as it is specifically meant for one Discord server. Big portion of the bot's features won't work in other
servers.
